<h3> Interstellar </h3>
<p> This is an amazing sci-fi movie. Watched it at least 5 times and it always amazes me.</p>

<h3> The Pursuit of Happiness </h3>
<p> This is also an amazing movie and tells what a human being goes through in order to achieve happiness. Happiness in little things.</p>

<h3> The Dark Knight </h3>
<p> Another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Loved the story and how the human mind works in different situations. A must watch for all.</p>
